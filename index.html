<article class="fig" id="about">
<p>I come to design from an academic program steeped in engineering, design studies, psychology, and a slew of other fields. That experience crossed with in-depth knowledge of the technology industry today makes me obsessive about user experience across the board. I'm as likely to examine the frame rate and backend of a product as I am the font choices and button placement. I'm currently at <a href="www.startupinstitute.com">Startup Institute Chicago</a> studying Product and Design.

  <p>Last year I proposed, designed, and implemented a photography position at the <a href="www.union.wisc.edu">Wisconsin Union</a>. This involved not only the technical backend required to quickly sort and distribute photos, but also how it would work within the broader organization including bridging the student and professional sides of the Union.</p>

	<h4>Summon Wireframe and Aesthetic Mockup</h4>

  <p class="summon">At Startup Institute I was on a team that went through the design process for Summon, an app meant to facilitate groups of friends hanging out in real life. Above is a wireframe that was made based on user research and the aesthetic mockup that resulted from that wireframe.</p>

	<h4>Summon User Flow</h4>
  <img src="images/shortUserFlow.png" alt="Summon App">
  <p class="summon">While mapping the user flow for Summon we began at an abstract level with what kinds of questions we would ask and how we could facilitate people getting through to the end goal of the application as quickly as possible. This flow shows the start and the steps needed to get someone to a final recommendation. After a lot of work we managed to get the user to their end goal in three screens.</p>

	<h4>EMR Survey Wireframe</h4>
  <img class="" src="images/epicMockupTall.png" alt="Summon App">
  <p class="summon">In designing a survey for a large EMR company I had to think about the various displays on which I could only show one survey, that restriction lead to me limiting the information shown at any one time with some autoscrolling to link between questions. Above is the initial wireframes.</p>

  <p>It's a little bit meta to do this, but I'm proud of my portfolio site itself. Rather than use a framework I challenged myself to code it from scratch. Hence the thought going into the order of content, immediate accessibility of it, and the speed of the site.</p>

		<p>Currently hailing from Wisconsin David is a recent graduate of UW-Madison. In the process of graduating he made: 
			<ol>
				<li>A creative writing group named Working Title</li>
				<li>His own major, titled Entrepreneurship, Design, and Technological Change</li>
				<li>His own job as Visual Media Manager at the Wisconsin Union</li>
				<li>Some awesome friends and memories</li>
			</ol>
		So yeah, those things happened. Now he's living in Chicago. He's a pretty awesome outdoorsman (see glacier picture above) and a pretty great photographer. He'll also talk your ear off about design and technology.</p>
