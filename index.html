<p>Currently hailing from Wisconsin David is a recent graduate of UW-Madison. In the process of graduating he made: 
	<ol>
		<li>A creative writing group named Working Title</li>
		<li>His own major, titled Entrepreneurship, Design, and Technological Change</li>
		<li>His own job as Visual Media Manager at the Wisconsin Union</li>
		<li>Some awesome friends and memories</li>
	</ol>
	So yeah, those things happened. Now he's living in Chicago. He's a pretty awesome outdoorsman (see glacier picture above) and a pretty great photographer. He'll also talk your ear off about design and technology.</p>
